                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is James McGinn, and I am currently enrolled in a full time programming bootcamp. I've decided to
                    transition out of the food service industry and pursue a passion of mine in web development. I've always
                    enjoyed a good puzzle and I feel there are no problems, only solutions, so web development is a good
                    fir for me professionally. I live in Chicago currently, but I am originally from the northern suburbs
                    of Chicago. I have lived in two foreign countries and I have visited about twenty others. English is
                    my mother tongue, but I speak a good amount of Spanish and a few other languages I have picked up during
                    my travels abroad.
