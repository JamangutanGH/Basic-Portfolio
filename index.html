    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is James McGinn, and I am currently enrolled in a full time programming bootcamp. I've decided to transition
        out of the food service industry and pursue a passion of mine in web development. I've always enjoyed a good puzzle
        and I feel there are no problems, only solutions, so web development is a good fir for me professionally. I live
        in Chicago currently, but I am originally from the northern suburbs of Chicago. I have lived in two foreign countries
        and I have visited about twenty others. English is my mother tongue, but I speak a good amount of Spanish and a few
        other languages I have picked up during my travels abroad.</p>
